Git notes:

To show the graph and to see abandoned forks:

git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

or 

git log --all --graph

index is staging area

to see all files in the HEAD commit:
  git ls-tree -r HEAD
or to see all files in the repo
  git ls-files
  
I did
git branch -f master 21def9e
to set ui_score to master

git branch -f {desired branch name} {commit hash}
  to set an arbitrary commit to a named branch
  great for making a forked branch that might be detached to the new master
