Git notes:

To show the graph and to see abandoned forks:

git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

or 

git log --all --graph

index is staging area

to see all files in the HEAD commit:
  git ls-tree -r HEAD
or to see all files in the repo
  git ls-files
  
I did
git branch -f master 21def9e
to set ui_score to master

git branch -f {desired branch name} {commit hash}
  to set an arbitrary commit to a named branch
  great for making a forked branch that might be detached to the new master
  
git log -p
  since commits are maybe actually just the deltas, git log -p just shows a log of all those deltas
  
git diff --cached
  diff the staged to the latest commit
  
To unstage file
  git reset -- filename.ext
  
in case if you want to redirect the stdout to the editor you can do:
  myprogram| gvim -

To hard reset a single file to HEAD:
  git checkout @ -- myfile.ext
To git diff against an empty repo:
  git diff 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904 HEAD
To md5sum recursively:
  find -type f \( -not -name "md5sum.txt" \) -exec md5sum '{}' \; > md5sum.txt
Docker exec
  docker exec -it {containerid} /bin/bash
docker run creates an image
docker start starts a container
To run a docker container or image and map the port:
  docker run -p{hostport}:{containerport} -d {imagename:imagesubname}
To compare commits:
  git diff hash
To compare commits using a difftool like vscode:
  git difftool hash
